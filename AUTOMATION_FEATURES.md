## Overview

This platform now includes comprehensive automation features that handle the entire social media content lifecycle from generation to posting.

## Key Automation Features

### 1. Automatic Post Generation on Signup

**What happens:**
- When a user signs up as an "individual", the system automatically generates 7 days of posts
- Posts are created based on the user's interests and custom prompt
- All posts are initially marked as "pending_approval"

**Technical details:**
- Uses AI (Gemini 2.0) to generate engaging content
- Creates posts for multiple platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter)
- Generates appropriate hashtags and captions
- Schedules posts starting from the next day

### 2. Calendar View with Approval System

**Features:**
- Visual calendar showing all posts with status indicators
- Color-coded post status (pending, approved, scheduled, posted)
- Batch management with approval controls
- Time scheduling for posting

**Status Colors:**
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Pending approval
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Approved
- ðŸ”µ Blue: Scheduled
- ðŸŸ£ Purple: Posted

### 3. Batch Approval System

**Process:**
1. User reviews generated posts in calendar view
2. Can approve entire batch with one click
3. Approved posts are automatically scheduled for posting
4. Next batch is generated after current one is approved

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/posts/batch-approve` - Approve all posts in a batch
- `GET /api/posts/pending-approval` - Get posts pending approval
- `GET /api/posts/batches` - Get all user batches

### 4. Automatic Scheduling

**Features:**
- Posts are scheduled at user's preferred time (default: 9:00 AM)
- Scheduler runs every 60 seconds to check for due posts
- Posts are automatically published to connected platforms
- Failed posts are marked and logged

**Scheduling Process:**
1. User sets preferred posting time
2. Approved posts are scheduled at that time
3. Scheduler checks for due posts every minute
4. Posts are published to all connected platforms

### 5. Continuous Content Generation

**Process:**
1. When current batch is approved, next batch is automatically generated
2. New batch starts 7 days after the last post
3. User receives notification when new batch is ready
4. Cycle continues automatically

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/posts/regenerate-next-batch` - Generate next 7 days of posts

### 6. Multi-Platform Integration

**Supported Platforms:**
- LinkedIn (with OAuth integration)
- Instagram (planned)
- Facebook (planned)
- Twitter (planned)

**Posting Process:**
1. Check which platforms are connected
2. Format content appropriately for each platform
3. Post simultaneously to all connected platforms
4. Track posting success/failure

### 7. Notification System

**Email Notifications:**
- **Batch Ready**: When new posts are generated and ready for approval
- **Approval Reminder**: When posts have been pending for too long
- **Posting Success**: When posts are successfully published

**Notification Triggers:**
- New batch generation
- Posts pending approval for 24+ hours
- Successful posting to platforms
